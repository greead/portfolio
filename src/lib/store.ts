        body:"I am currently in my first year of graduate school at Purdue Fort Wayne. It is definitely more difficult than undergrad, but it is also very fun! After completing my Bachelor's degree, I found that I loved research, programming, science, and math. So, I applied to a Master's program that could give me all of that and more! I don't have any regrets so far.",

The focus of this camp was to not only get students excited in the field of computing, but to also expose them to other computing fields that they might not have known were options. My background made me especially equipped for this because my studies put me in contact with computer engineering, IT, and CS (the computing fields represented at the camp).",

In addition to my major in Computer Engineering Technology, I pursued a minor in Math and a minor in Computer Science. I pursued these minors because I found a genuine fondness for Math and Computer Science that was introduced in the program, but not expanded upon. Alongside my studies, I did several extracurricular research projects, participated in a Co-Op, and made many good friends.",
