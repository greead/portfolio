        <h2>Professionally</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>

            <li>
                I am an experienced programmer and problem solver with a passion
                for learning new technologies
            </li>
            <li>
                I have a growth mindset and hate leaving a good problem
                unsolved, which has naturally lead me to develop great debugging
                skills
            </li>
            <li>
                I strongly believe that having varied experiences (including
                failure) and knowledge leads to deeper understanding and
                incredible moments of unlikely inspiration
            </li>
            <li>
                I am a team player and natural leader with ample experience
                working in groups and leading small teams
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Personally</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                My biggest hobbies are playing games, reading and learning new
                things, trying new foods and restaurants, and drinking hot
                drinks
            </li>
            <li>
                My favorite games include League of Legends, World of Warcraft,
                Magic: the Gathering, and the Pathfinder RPG
            </li>
            <li>
                I am a huge fan of worldbuilding and lore, often reading lore
                for games and settings which I don't play or otherwise know
                anything about
            </li>
            <li>
                I'm constantly studying new things and working on projects like
                learning about graphics programming and making games
            </li>
            <li>
                My favorite hot drinks are rooibos tea, jasmine tea, masala
                chai, blonde roast black coffee, hot apple cider, and hot
                chocolate
            </li>
            <li>
                My favorite color is green (mint green specifically, and you
                should have seen that coming)
            </li>
            <li>
                My favorite quote is,
                <div class="quote">
                    <q>
                        Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing
                        is going to get better. It's not.
                    </q>
