            Hello, I'm Alekzander Green. I'm a {yearsOld} year old aspiring software engineer with a passion for programming. I recently graduated from Purdue University with an M.S. in Computer Science.
            I previously graduated from Purdue with a B.S. in Computer Engineering Technology, an A.S. in Electrical Engineering Technology, and a couple minors in CS and Math.
            I currently work at Purdue University, Fort Wayne as a lecturer teaching introductory programming in Python.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am an experienced programmer and problem solver with a penchant for intellectual curiosity.
            I strongly believe that having varied experiences and knowledge will lead to deeper understanding and incredible moments of unlikely inspiration. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I have experience in a wide variety of topics such as game programming, data analysis, web servers, web clients, databases, application programming, machine learning, embedded programming, and much more.
            My repetoire of programming languages includes C/C++, C#, Python, Java, Kotlin, PHP, and JavaScript.
            I've worked with several specific frameworks and technologies like Unreal Engine 5, Unity, Godot, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Django, SvelteKit, FastAPI, Svelte, React, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB, .NET Core, Android Studio, Sci-Kit Learn, and TensorFlow.

            Personally

        <p>
            Hey there, I'm Alekz! I have a million-and-one interests and I truly enjoy learning. My biggest hobbies are playing games, reading, trying new restaurants, and drinking tea.
        </p>
        <p>            
            Some of my favorite games are League of Legends, World of Warcraft, Pokemon, Magic: the Gathering, and the Pathfinder RPG.
            I am a big fan of worldbuilding and lore, sometimes reading lore for games and settings that I don't play or otherwise read.
            In my spare time, when not playing games, eating, or reading, I like to work on making games in Unreal, with my current project being a dynamic MMORPG.
        </p>
        <p>
            My favorite teas are rooibos, jasmine, and masala chai; my favorite color is green; and my favorite quote is,
        </p>
