        <p>
            Hello, I'm Alekzander Green. I'm a {yearsOld} year old graduate student at Purdue University Fort Wayne (PFW) studying computer science. 
            I graduated from PFW with a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering Technology with a minor in math and CS on the side. 
            I am very active at the school where I currently teach an introductory programming class, work on extracurricular research, and work with other professors to improve teaching materials.
            I've worked since I was 15 in the food industry, and eventually worked to become a shift manager at a Pizza Hut in my city.
            Since then I've been working in academia or with different companies in the area.
            I am a good programmer and problem solver who likes to learn new things and tackle interesting problems.
            I have experience with C, C#, Python, Java, Kotlin, and JavaScript; this includes their applications with things like embedded programming, Unity, machine learning, data analysis, Android programming, GUI & CLI applications, web servers, and web clients.
        </p>

            Hi, I'm Alekz! I have a million-and-one interests about anything and everything (I truly like to learn).
            The things I enjoy doing the most are reading, trying new foods or restaurants, drinking tea, and playing games!
            If I had to give my top 5 games, they would be: League of Legends, World of Warcraft, anything Pokemon, Magic the Gathering, and the Pathfinder RPG.
            When I play Pathfinder, I usually am the Game Master because I love worldbuilding and lore.
            I sometimes even read lore for games I don't play because I'm a sucker for the interesting tidbits that someone put effort into crafting.
            My favorite teas are rooibos, jasmine, and chai; my favorite anime right now is Jujutsu Kaisen; my favorite color is green (shocking right?); and my favorite quote is,
        </p>
