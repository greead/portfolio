## Portfolio project
Alekzander Green

### Summary
As part of my job and internship searches, I have found that many companies want to see a project portfolio. I found this to be a perfect opportunity to express my web coding skills by putting together a portfolio that is meant to be hosted on GitHub pages or any other hosting platform. I could, alternatively, host this portfolio locally using an Apache webserver or via other hosting services. However, I chose to use GitHub pages as it is free and serves my purposes.
